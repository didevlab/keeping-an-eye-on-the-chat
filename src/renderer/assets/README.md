# Mascot Asset

Place the Rive mascot file at:

- mascot.riv

The renderer loads this file via a relative path and falls back to the CSS avatar if missing.

Download a sample (testing only):
```
npm run fetch:rive-sample
```

The downloaded file is only for local testing and may not match the required
`Mascot` artboard / `Overlay` (MascotSM) state machine contract names.
